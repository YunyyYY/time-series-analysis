### `qnorm()`

Reference at https://homerhanumat.github.io/tigerstats/qnorm.html.

```{r}
qnorm(p, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)
```

Given an area, `qnorm()` finds the boundary value that determines this area. If mean or sd are not specified they assume the default values of 0 and 1 respectively.

For example, 
```{r}
qnorm(0.975)
```
means $P(x\leq1.645) = 0.95$. We can check this with `pnormGC()`, which does the opposite work (from value to probability):
```{r}
pnormGC(1.959964,region="below",graph=TRUE)
```

### `rnorm`
```{r}
rnorm(n=5,sd=1.56)
```

Used to generate `n` numbers from a normal distribution of zero mean and standard deviation `sd`.
