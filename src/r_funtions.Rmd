### `I()`
Inhibit Interpretation/Conversion of Objects. Change the class of an object to indicate that it should be treated "as is". e.g., `I(x^2)` would return a vector of values raised to the second power.

### `ts()`
 
`ts` class tells R the units of time. It also helps R choose other plotting options in a way appriate for time series. 

```{r, include=FALSE}
U1 <- read.table(file="data/unadjusted_unemployment.csv", sep=",",header=TRUE)
u1 <- t(as.matrix(U1[2:13]))  # t() get transpose of matrix.
dim(u1) <- NULL  # dim() retrieve or set the dimension of an object. Convert marix u1 to an 1D array
date <- seq(from=1948,length=length(u1),by=1/12)  # generate sequence, `by` is increment.
```

```{r}
u1_ts <- ts(u1,start=1948,frequency=12)
plot(u1_ts)
```

For a report, we should add units to plots. Extra details (like bandwith in the periodogram plot) should be explained or removed.
